          <p>
            I’m always struggling with trying to fit in and trying to please and trying to try I’m always trying
            something but that something always seems to be missing something. What is this nagging feeling biting at my
            heels every day? It’s here making me feel less then or not equal too, I feel like I don’t belong anyplace at
            all. Despite being a model student and getting great grades and being active in the groups and clubs on
            campus and having lots of good friends around me, I still always feel like I am doing something wrong or
            like I shouldn’t be there or worse of all that at any minute my awful past was going to somehow disqualify
            me from having any kind of good future. Am I justified in feeling like this? I mean I did have a sketchy
            past that landed me in prison for 3 years. I did use drugs at one time, so doesn’t that mean I shouldn’t be
            able to succeed now?
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve heard in the past and in many variations that the person we often find hardest to forgive, is usually
            ourselves. This is, I am learning the first step in moving forward and growing; having the ability to
            forgive oneself for the mistakes that one has made. It has taken me some time to realize that as long as I
            am not repeating the same mistakes and as long as I had learned something from the mistakes then they were
            not really mistakes but lessons learned. Let me add that I have had to learn many lessons the hard way, it
            always seemed to take me a little extra to learn anything back then. I wish I could of knew then what I know
            now, everything would be different. Don’t we all pretty much say that.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is some pretty good research and testimonials out there on the web dealing with this exact topic and
           issue.” Feeling like a big fake” is no fun and I guess I am no where close to being alone in feeling this
           way. Having the resources available has made tackling this issue for me much easier and more bearable. It has
           giving me the knowledge needed to see my own behaviors and faults and shed light on ways to manage these
           feeling and make real the facts that EVERYONE is worthy of success and a second chance at life. Including me,
           and with the world wide web as my witness this is my second chance now. But what about these feelings what
           are they and why do I feel them?
          </p>
          <p>
            According to psychologytoday.com “imposter syndrome is a psychological term referring to a pattern of
            behavior where people doubt their accomplishments and have a persistent, often internalized fear of being
            exposed as a fraud.”
          </p>
          <p>
            This brief definition does a decent job of summing up these complicated feeling so many of us struggle with.
            As well, within the same psychologytoday.com site there is a nice short article by Megan Della-Camina titled
            ‘The Reality of Imposter Syndrome’. She writes about how this syndrome is more known about within woman
            circles and groups but that studies have shown that it effects both men and woman about equally.(
            Dalla-Camina,2018) Which to me reinforces the idea that woman are more open about feelings and emotions and
            are more likely to talk about these things with each other than the more ridged and masculine approach that
            men usually take on life. But speaking from a neutral position I think it affects even the rarest of alien
            races just as well.
          </p>
          <p>
             All jokes aside, this can be a debilitating feeling at times, which for me becomes so intense that I just
             want to curl up into a ball and hide from the world, so I don’t have to face the facts. What are the facts
             though? In my mind they are things like; I did so many bad things I don’t disserve this, I am not smart
             enough to learn all this or I could barely understand the algebra how am I going to learn programming? I’m
             just a Hack with a dream and nothing more, Ill never fit in with the developers and programmers I look up
             too, It must be a fluke that I got this far even, this has got to be some kind of cosmic joke or something,
             any minute the magic carpet is going to be ripped out form underneath me and I’m going to be right back
             where I belong in the gutters going nowhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            But of course, this stuff isn’t true at all, these are the lies I tell myself in order to try and justify a
            later self-sabotage. I always sabotage my own successes and wins in life which I know now was just a way to
            control the situation by using lack of control as an excuse to manipulate my own thinking into thinking it
            was the only way to deal with things when really If I just took myself out of that loop and down a different
            path a whole new array of options would open up and be available. New choices to what seemed like a stale
            old me, what really needed to change wasn’t the choices, it was me. And that’s what I am doing, and in so
            doing inadvertently filled up my head with inadequacies. Trying to learn a new technical craft at my age
            with very little technical experience has really showed me how little I know.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because someone doesn’t necessarily know something doesn’t mean that the capacity to know it isn’t there.
            When we want something, we will usually find a way to make it happen, it’s just that the process takes time
            and energy. While I was learning to paint houses one of my Bosses once said even if you don’t know something
            pretend you do and keep practicing and one day it won’t be pretend. He said Everyone has been there its what
            he called the “fake it till you make it position.” Point being, we are all beginners at one point, we all
            must go through the process of acquiring skills and knowledge. And the early stages are tough on people, I
            know I am always filled with the fear that I am not learning fast enough, that everyone is so much more
            advanced then myself how will I ever catch up? With hard work and determination, I hope. As well I just want
            to add that I do not condone lying about one’s skills to an employer just to get a job. I do not want the
            “fake it until you make it” analogy to be an excuse to lie or pretend in a professional setting. It was
            simply meant to show how we all must be beginners with a bit of fear before we can become masters with a bit
            of wisdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the American Psychological Association website, I found a great newsletter from November 2017, called
            “Overcoming imposter syndrome” by Andrea Robonson, PhD. And right in this article under ways to fight
            feeling like an imposter is the “fake it ‘til you make it”. Dr Robonson goes on to say “Sometimes faking it
            is okay. If you don’t feel confident, pretend you do; by imitating confidence, competence and an optimistic
            mindset, you can realize those qualities in your real life.” Other techniques mentioned in this great
            newsletter are things like; Look at the evidence or celebrate your successes and remember, lots of people
            feel this way and my favorite one of all, we are told to “Stay Humble.” (Robonson, 2017)
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to leave you with a brief video about the subject which helps to clarify what it is exactly and how
            we can start combating these nagging feeling that fill our thoughts today, the sooner we talk about how we
            are feeling the faster we can begin the journey to wholeness. And with that I leave you with this;
